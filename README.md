# ECO

### Setting & Context
Climate change constitutes an existential threat to our planet. Not only is systemic change necessary, but we as individuals need to change how we live. However, human contribution to environmental changes can occur in many ways, unintentionally or intentionally. This includes car emissions, energy consumption, trash output etc.. A polluted environment may harm us in many ways, including viruses, bacteria, and diseases. 
We are proposing an app that can help people keep track of their contributions to the environment and try to offset that contribution. It will give users a score that reflects their carbon/ecological footprint; users would be able to see the scores of their friends, have access to a daily checklist, and be able to lower their scores through carbon offsets or cleaning up their local environment. All in all, this app will encourage users to help clean our environment.

### Deliverables
Mobile application on iOS and Android

### Materials
Software: React, MySql, Python
Hardware: IOS mobile


### Problem and Rationale
The purpose of this app is to help solve the climate crisis and help people clean up our environment even if it is the smallest amount. A possible issue we could encounter is showing live leaderboard data and developing the social media platform. We will use React, MySql, and Python to develop the application.
